## Description

_HelloID-Conn-SA-Full-AD-GroupManageMemberships_ is a delegated form designed for use with HelloID Service Automation (SA). It can be imported into HelloID and customized according to your requirements.

By using this delegated form, you can manage Active Directory group memberships. The following options are available:

1. Search for and select the target Active Directory (AD) group by Name or Mail address.
2. View all available AD users (from specified OUs) and the current members of the selected group.
3. Add or remove multiple users to/from the selected group with comprehensive audit logging.

## Getting started

### Requirements

• **Active Directory Access**:
  The connector requires access to an Active Directory domain with sufficient permissions to add and remove group memberships. A service account with appropriate AD permissions is necessary.

• **HelloID Agent**:
  A HelloID Agent must be installed and configured to communicate with the Active Directory domain.

• **PowerShell module 'ActiveDirectory'**:
  The HelloID Agent must have PowerShell available with Active Directory module support.

### Connection settings

The following user-defined variables are used by the connector.

| Setting | Description | Mandatory |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| ADgroupsSearchOU | Array of Active Directory OUs for scoping AD groups in the search result of this form | Yes |
| ADusersSearchOU | Array of Active Directory OUs for scoping AD user accounts available in this form | Yes |

## Remarks

### Group Search

• **Search Functionality:** Users can search for groups using a wildcard (`*`) to return all groups within the specified OUs, or by entering partial text to search across group Name and Mail attributes.

• **The search scope is limited to the OUs defined in the `ADgroupsSearchOU` variable.**

### User Search

• **Search Functionality:** users are retrieved from the Active Directory OUs specified in the `ADusersSearchOU` variable.

• **Users without a name are filtered out.**
